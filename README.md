Likely you wont see this... BUUUUT if you 🌀 The Dimensional Engine | V14"Reality is just a setting."The Dimensional Engine V14 is a high-performance physics playground built with Matter.js and p5.js. It features two distinct playstyles: a 9-stage Dimensional Journey through shifting laws of physics, and a Sandbox Chaos mode for structural destruction.🕹️ Game Modes1. Dimensional Mode (A/D to Traverse)Shift between 9 unique dimensions, each with its own physical rules and "Primary Ability."1D (Line): Movement restricted to a single axis.3D (Hypercubes): Spawns dual-linked geometric bodies.4D (Time): Objects leave "Time Trails" documenting their past positions.5D (Multiverse): Objects that pass through "Splitters" are instantly cloned.6D (Wormholes): Dual-portal teleportation logic.8D (The Web): Zero-gravity environment where objects attract each other via "Quantum Strands."9D (Glitch): Reality breaks. Gravity is randomized, and colors invert rapidly.2. Sandbox ChaosA traditional high-gravity environment designed for testing the engine's most destructive tools.🛠️ The Toolkit (Keyboard Shortcuts)KeyToolDescription1Primary AbilitySpawns the unique object for the current Dimension.2BallHigh-restitution circular body.3 / 4ChainsStandard or "Rainbow Tracer" physics constraints.5 / 6The ShreddersSaws and Meat Grinders that shrink/destroy overlapping bodies.7SwordHigh-density rectangular blade.8Kinetic GunFires high-velocity projectiles with a custom crosshair.0VehicleSpawns a multi-part car with functional suspension constraints.FFlamethrower(Hold) Spawns temporary heat particles that shrink over time.KKhaby HandsSpawns static deflection platforms.⚙️ Technical ArchitectureThis engine runs on a dual-library stack:Physics Core: Matter.js (Engine, World, Composite, and Constraint modules).Rendering: p5.js (Canvas API for custom polygon drawing and frame-based animations).Collision Logic: Custom Matter.Bounds.overlaps checks for the Grinder and Saw tools.Advanced Rendering: Includes HSB color-shifting for tracers and alpha-blending for time trails.
